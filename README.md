# TRAX LRS 3.0 - Extended Edition

## About TRAX LRS

TRAX LRS is an xAPI conformant **Learning Record Store (LRS)** built with the excellent Laravel framework.
It’s not a Learning Analytics solution. It’s a pure LRS. It focuses on storing and managing learning data, and that’s it.
We want to keep it simple and clean, and give you the freedom to build what you want around it.

## Release number

If you already installed TRAX LRS, you can see the release number on the login page, above the authentication form.
